Refer to final document for instructions on running the project or goto http://reel.great-site.net/

If you wanted to run the program on localhost, you would need to download the 64-bit WAMP server. After downloading the WAMP server, download the project folder off of github (CPSC471Project) and extract its contents into a singular folder. Place this folder into the directory where your WAMP server is located in the www folder. Click on system tray on the bottom right and open WAMP, click on PHPmyadmin and create a new database by the name of movietheatre and then go to import and click on the movietheatre.sql file located in the extracted data. Then you can go to localhost/(name of folder where contents are extracted) in order to access the website.
